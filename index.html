  <p class="p1">Well.. umm look I didn't fell in love with you because I was alone or I needed someone to make me happy or that i couldn't function without you. I... fell in love with you 
    because when you were around good things just got better, and the bad things didn't seem so awful. You see I fell in love with you for the sole reason, that it just felt right.  </p>

  <p class="p2"> Yes, Shilpi ❤️, I have fallen deeply in love with you. Your laughter is my melody, your smile my sunshine, and your presence my solace. Every moment spent in your company feels like a glimpse of paradise, and I find myself longing for more.</p>
  <p class="p3">I cherish every memory we've shared, every whispered conversation, every stolen glance. Each one is etched into the fabric of my soul, a testament to the depth of my affection for you.</p>
